/**
 * Spec catalog — framework-internal index of every `parton`
 * spec by its catalog id.
 *
 * Lookups feed three internal consumers:
 *
 *  - `partialFromSnapshot` in cache-mode refetch — finds the spec
 *    Component when re-spawning from a snapshot.
 *  - `descendantContribution` in the descendant-fp fold — re-runs a
 *    descendant's `match` against the current request to keep
 *    ancestors' fingerprints honest.
 *  - `deriveMatchKey` walking `parent.path` — looks up ancestors to
 *    find the closest match-bearing pattern for variant identity.
 *
 * No CMS coupling: this catalog knows about spec id, render component,
 * and match pattern. CMS-specific block metadata
 * (`schema` callbacks, slot-allow labels) lives separately in
 * `runtime/cms-runtime.ts` as a side-table.
