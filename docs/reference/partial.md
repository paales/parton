# `ReactCms.partial(Render, …)`

The framework's base addressable-render-unit constructor. A spec is
constructed once at module scope from a `Render` function and an
options object; the call returns a placeable React component. Every
request dependency the spec has — URL, search, cookies, headers,
session — lives in a single sync `vary` function whose result is the
cache-key surface.

> **Three constructors, one engine.** `partial` is the base case.
> Slot-placeable CMS-driven units use [`ReactCms.block`](./block.md);
> frame-scope openers use the `<Frame>` component
> ([frames-navigation.md](./frames-navigation.md)). All three produce
> partials at runtime — same registry, same fingerprint pipeline,
> same refetch path.

```tsx
import { ReactCms, ROOT, type RenderArgs } from "./lib"

const PokemonPage = ReactCms.partial(PokemonRender, "/pokemon/:id")

function PokemonRender({ id, parent }: { id: string } & RenderArgs) {
  return <article>...{id}...</article>
}

// Anywhere in JSX:
<PokemonPage parent={ROOT} />
```

## Tier 1 — pattern-match shorthand

When a string is passed as the second argument, it's treated as the
`match` pattern. On miss, the spec doesn't render. Pattern params
flow into `Render`'s props directly.

```tsx
const HomePage = ReactCms.partial(Home, "/")
const PokemonPage = ReactCms.partial(PokemonRender, "/pokemon/:id")
```

### Match grammar — what flows into props

`ParseRoute<T>` infers a `{ name: string }` shape from the pattern at
the type level. URLPattern syntax handled:

| Pattern | Type |
|---|---|
| `/:foo` | `{ foo: string }` |
| `/:foo?` | `{ foo?: string }` (optional) |
| `/:foo+` / `/:foo*` | `{ foo: string }` (URLPattern flattens repeats to one string) |
| `/:foo(\d+)` | `{ foo: string }` (regex constraint at runtime; value stays string) |
| `/*` | not in result (anonymous wildcard) |
| `/{group}?` | bracket-stripped; named params inside parse normally |

URLPattern is the source of truth for what actually matches at runtime;
unparseable corners fall through and the prop is just absent. Coerce
inside `vary` (or `Render`) when you need a non-string shape:

```tsx
vary: ({ params }) => ({ id: Number(params.id) })
```

## Tier 2 — options object

```tsx
const ProductHero = ReactCms.partial(ProductHeroRender, {
  match: "/p/:slug",
  cache: { maxAge: 60 },
  vary: ({ params, search: { variant = "default" } }) => ({
    slug: params.slug,
    variant,
  }),
})

async function ProductHeroRender({
  slug, variant, parent,
}: { slug: string; variant: string } & RenderArgs) {
  const product = await getProduct(slug)
  return <Hero parent={parent} product={product} variant={variant} />
}
```

For CMS-driven content (text, images, references), use
[`ReactCms.block`](./block.md) with a `schema` callback.

`match` runs first; on miss, `vary` doesn't run. On match, the
pattern's params land in `vary`'s `params` arg. When `vary` returns
`null`, the spec also doesn't render.

## Options

```ts
interface PartialOptions<V> {
  match?: MatchPattern                             // URLPattern gate
  vary?: (scope: VaryScope) => V | null            // null = skip render
  selector?: SelectorTokens                        // auto-derived from Render.name
  cache?: CacheOptions
  defer?: true | ReactElement<ActivatorProps>
  fallback?: ReactNode
}
```

| Option | Notes |
|---|---|
| `match` | URLPattern pathname (or full `URLPatternInit`). `/p/:slug`, `/p/:slug/reviews/:page`, `/inspect/*` (descendants only), `/inspect{/*}?` (bare + descendants). Pattern miss → spec emits nothing. Anonymous `*` captures don't flow into the default fingerprint — only named groups (`:foo`) do. |
| `vary` | Sync function. Receives `{ url, pathname, search, cookies, headers, params, session }`. Returns the request-dimensions dependency surface or `null`. **No `cms` here** — CMS reads live on `ReactCms.block`'s `schema` callback. |
| `selector` | Defaults to `#<kebab-cased Render.name minus Page/Block/Render/Partial suffix>`. Accepts both `#unique` and `.shared` class tokens for refetch targeting (e.g. `"#hero .featured"`). |
| `cache` | See [`cache.md`](./cache.md). |
| `defer` | `true` for app-driven, an activator element to wire automatically. |
| `fallback` | React node rendered while the partial's body is suspended. |

## `VaryScope`

```ts
interface VaryScope {
  url: URL                                  // frame-resolved if framed
  pathname: string                          // shortcut for url.pathname
  search: Partial<Record<string, string>>   // destructurable
  cookies: Partial<Record<string, string>>  // destructurable
  headers: Partial<Record<string, string>>  // lowercase keys
  params: Record<string, string>            // from `match`
  session: SessionReadSurface               // per-key session reads
}
```

`vary` is strictly request-dimensions: URL fields, cookies, headers,
match params, session values. CMS content reads happen on
[`ReactCms.block`](./block.md)'s `schema` callback (which receives a
`{ cms }` scope) — the framework folds the resolved CMS shape into
the block's fingerprint via `cmsFingerprintContribution` independently
of whether the block's render touched specific fields.

## `Render` props

`Render` receives, in order: any extra props passed at the JSX call
site, the `vary` result spread, the framework-injected
`parent`/`cmsId`/`children`. Vary keys win on collision.

| Key | Source |
|---|---|
| `<JSX call-site props>` | parent spec, e.g. `<Hero parent={p} pokemonId={id} />` |
| `<every key from vary's return>` | author |
| `parent` | framework — fresh `PartialCtx` for descendants |
| `cmsId` | framework — effective cmsId (override-aware) |
| `children` | framework — passes outer JSX children through |

`parent` is what nested specs and slot hosts use; `cmsId` is what
slot primitives pass as `hostCmsId`.

### `typeof Spec.props` — derive the prop bag from the spec

The returned spec carries a phantom `.props` type that resolves to the
prop bag the framework supplies to `Render` (`vary` result + match
params + `RenderArgs`). Use it to skip retyping the same shape across
sibling factories or hooks:

```tsx
const Hero = ReactCms.partial(HeroRender, { match: "/pokemon/:id" })
type HeroProps = typeof Hero.props          // { id: string } & RenderArgs
function HeroRender({ id }: HeroProps) { … }

// `.props` has no runtime value — it's a type-only phantom.
```

The forward-reference shape (`const Spec = partial(R, opts);
function R(p: typeof Spec.props)`) hits a circular initializer in TS.
Use the two-step builder below if you need the type before the Render
exists.

### Two-step builder — `partial(opts)`

When the Render is declared after the spec OR you want the prop type
to drive the function signature directly, call `partial` with just
options. The result is a callable builder that exposes `.props` for
forward-reference inference:

```tsx
const HeroBuilder = ReactCms.partial({ match: "/pokemon/:id" })
function HeroRender(p: typeof HeroBuilder.props) {
  return <article>#{p.id}</article>
}
const Hero = HeroBuilder(HeroRender)
```

The two-step form produces an identical spec to the single-step form;
it just orders the type plumbing differently to dodge the cycle.

### Call-site prop pass-through

`ReactCms.partial(Render, …)` feels like `React.memo(Render)`: the
returned component's prop signature is Render's prop signature minus
the keys `vary` already provides minus the framework-injected keys.
TypeScript subtracts both, so the call site is exactly the props the
parent has to supply.

```tsx
// vary fills `pokemonId` → call site only takes `parent`
const Hero = ReactCms.partial(HeroRender, {
  match: "/pokemon/:id",
  vary: ({ params }) => ({ pokemonId: Number(params.id) }),
})
function HeroRender({ pokemonId }: { pokemonId: number } & RenderArgs) { … }
<Hero parent={ROOT} />
```

```tsx
// no vary → `pokemonId` is required at the call site
const Hero = ReactCms.partial(function HeroRender({
  pokemonId,
}: { pokemonId: number } & RenderArgs) { … })
<Hero parent={parent} pokemonId={9} />
```

This is what makes nested wrappers work: an outer wrapper matches
the URL once, then threads typed props down to its children without
forcing each child to re-parse the URL.

```tsx
const PokemonDetailPage = ReactCms.partial(
  function PokemonDetailRender({ id, parent }: { id: string } & RenderArgs) {
    return (
      <>
        <Hero parent={parent} id={id} />
        <Stats parent={parent} id={id} />
        <Species parent={parent} id={id} />
      </>
    )
  },
  { match: "/pokemon/:id" },
)

// Inner specs have no `match`, no `vary` — the wrapper gates the
// route once and passes `id` as a prop.
const Hero = ReactCms.partial(async function HeroRender({
  id,
}: { id: string } & RenderArgs) {
  const data = await client.request(PokemonHeroQuery, { id: Number(id) })
  …
})
```

`{ match: "/pokemon/:id" }` alone is enough — `ParseRoute<P>` extracts
`:id` from the pattern at the type level and auto-flows it as a typed
`{ id: string }` into Render. Add a `vary` only when you need to
reshape the params (coercion, defaults, derived values). Call-site
props are part of the cache fingerprint automatically — two parents
passing different `id` values produce different cache entries.

The framework captures the call-site props in the spec's snapshot
so a partial-refetch (cache-mode `?partials=…`) can re-invoke the
child without going through its parent and still receive the same
props. This is per-user-session state — concurrent requests from
the same scope passing different prop values for the same partial
id could race; the proper fix is wiring props through the client
so refetches carry the props they were originally rendered with.

## Slots

A partial (or block) that hosts CMS-managed children uses `<Children>`
/ `<Child>` to render entries from a CMS slot. The entries are looked
up in the type catalog — see [`block.md`](./block.md) for how blocks
register and get placed into slots.

```tsx
import { Children, Child } from "./lib"

function PageRootRender({ parent, cmsId }: RenderArgs) {
  return (
    <main>
      <Children name="body" allow=".page-block" host={parent} hostCmsId={cmsId} />
      <aside>
        <Child name="sidebar" allow=".widget" host={parent} hostCmsId={cmsId} />
      </aside>
    </main>
  )
}
```

| Component | Renders |
|---|---|
| `<Children name allow host hostCmsId>` | Every entry in `node.slots[name]` in stored order, each rendered through its registered block spec with `cmsId={entry.id}` override. |
| `<Child name allow host hostCmsId>` | At most one entry. |

`host` becomes the placed block's `parent`. `hostCmsId` is the parent
node whose `slots[name]` array to read.

## Selector grammar

CSS-style. Tokens separated by whitespace.

- `#foo` — unique. A second spec with the same `#foo` is a render
  error. Drives `reload({ selector: "#foo" })` lookup.
- `.foo` — shared. Multiple specs may carry it. Refetches by `.foo`
  union across every carrier.

Auto-derived from `Render.name`: `PokemonHeroRender` → `#pokemon-hero`.

## Skip semantics

A spec doesn't render in three cases:

1. `match` is set and the URL didn't match.
2. `vary` returned `null`.
3. The client's cached fingerprint matches this render's fingerprint
   (the `?cached=` skip handshake).

Cases 1 and 2 emit nothing. Case 3 emits a placeholder so the client
paints from `_currentPagePartials`.

### Transitive fingerprint propagation

A spec's fingerprint folds every previously-registered descendant
spec's contribution, resolved against the *current* request via the
spec catalog's `match` + `vary`. A wrapper that doesn't itself
declare a URL dependency still produces a different fingerprint when
any of its descendants would render differently. So an ancestor
fp-skip can never serve a stale subtree, and authors don't need to
hand-fold descendant deps (`__href: url.href`) into a wrapper's
vary just to keep the children fresh.

Wrappers called with `outerChildren` (transparent passthrough)
skip fp-skip entirely — their output IS their children, which the
JSX parent renders directly.

## Page-level routing — wrapper specs

Page routing is just specs with `match`. There's no separate router
primitive — an outer wrapper spec gates the URL once, its children
are nested specs that take their data via JSX props or `vary`.

```tsx
const PokemonDetailPage = ReactCms.partial(
  function PokemonDetailRender({ id, parent }: { id: string } & RenderArgs) {
    return (
      <>
        <Hero parent={parent} id={id} />
        <Stats parent={parent} id={id} />
        <Species parent={parent} id={id} />
      </>
    )
  },
  { match: "/pokemon/:id" },
)

// Place every page wrapper as a sibling at the root; only the
// matching one renders.
<PokemonOverviewPage parent={ROOT} />
<PokemonDetailPage parent={ROOT} />
<CmsDemoPage parent={ROOT} />
…
```

Each wrapper self-gates: on a `match` miss it emits nothing. Inner
specs don't need their own `match` — the wrapper already filtered.

### 404 fallback

`getRegisteredMatchPatterns()` returns every `match` pattern any
spec was constructed with. A `NotFoundFallback` spec checks the URL
against that set; if no pattern matches, it calls `notFound()`,
which `Root` catches and turns into HTTP 404 + `<NotFoundPage>`.

```tsx
import { ReactCms, getRegisteredMatchPatterns } from "./lib"
import { matchRoutePattern } from "./framework/context"
import { notFound } from "./framework/errors"

export const NotFoundFallback = ReactCms.partial(
  function NotFoundFallbackRender() {
    notFound()
    return null
  },
  {
    vary: ({ request }) => {
      const p = new URL(request.url).pathname
      for (const pattern of getRegisteredMatchPatterns()) {
        if (matchRoutePattern(p, pattern) !== null) return null
      }
      return {}
    },
  },
)

// Place once alongside the other page wrappers.
<NotFoundFallback parent={ROOT} />
```

The set is populated as a side-effect of every `ReactCms.partial(…,
{ match: … })` call; no explicit registration needed.

## Sharp edges

- **Slot-placeable units use `ReactCms.block`.** `ReactCms.partial`
  produces non-slot-placeable specs — they're placed by JSX, addressed
  by selector. Slots look up their entries through the type catalog,
  which only `block`-constructed specs register in. See
  [`block.md`](./block.md).
- **CMS reads live on blocks, not partials.** `vary` is strictly
  request-dimensions (URL / cookies / headers / session). To bind a
  partial's content to the CMS, either use `ReactCms.block` with
  `schema`, or have the partial host a `<Children>` slot whose
  entries are blocks.
- **`closest` / ancestor `provides`.** Punted. Specs that need
  ancestor data should accept it as a render prop (manual threading
  from a parent spec's `vary`).
- **Spec metadata doesn't cross the RSC boundary.** Spec components
  are server-only — don't import a spec into a client component to
  reach for its `id`. Reload calls stay stringly-typed
  (`reload({ selector: "#hero" })`).
